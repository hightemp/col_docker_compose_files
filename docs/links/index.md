- **docker-phpvirtualbox**
    The master of the master branch supports only VirtualBox up to version 5.2. Later versions of VirtualBox are supported by the branch VBOX6.x - this will take the developement branch of phpVirtualBox and includes it into this docker image.

- **docker-registry-driver-gcs**
    Update, February 2015: We've launched Google Container Registry and recommend using it instead of google/docker-registry. Google Container Registry is a private Docker registry running on Google Cloud Storage. It uses the same authentication, storage, and billing as google/docker-registry, without the need to run your own registry. Images on Google Container Registry can be accessed easily from Google Compute Engine, Managed VMs, Google Container Engine, non-Google cloud providers, or your own machines.
